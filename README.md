# Apache AGE website

## Introduction

* The `master` branch contains the source code of the latest version of the documentation.
* `vX.Y.Z` Branches contain the source code of the documentation of releases.
* The `asf-site` branch contains the static webpage code, as well as the build static version of the documenation (in the `docs` folder). The `docs` folder should not be manually updated.

## Build the documentation locally (first time)

* Install requirements (the latex and dvisvgm commands are required to display math)

- **MacOS**
```shell
brew install python3 virtualenv texlive
```

- **Ubuntu**
```shell
sudo apt install python3 virtualenv texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-extra texlive-extra-utils
```

* Clone this repository
* Navigate to the root of the repository
* Create a python virtual environment

```shell
virtualenv -p python3 venv
```

* Activate the virtual environment

```shell
source venv/bin/activate
```

* Install the python requirements

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Build the documentation
  * From :warning: remote branches

    ```shell
    sphinx-multiversion docs build/html
    ```

    The documentation should now be in the `build/html` folder, with a subfolder per remote branch (version).

  * From the current folder

    ```shell
    sphinx-build docs build/html/current
    ```

    The documentation for the current local branch should now be in the `build/html/current` folder (no subfolders).

## Build documentation locally (after initial setup)

* Navigate to the root of the repository

* Activate the virtual environment if not yet active

```shell
source venv/bin/activate
```

* Build the documentation
  * From :warning: remote branches

    ```shell
    sphinx-multiversion docs build/html
    ```

    The documentation should now be in the `build/html` folder, with a subfolder per remote branch (version).

  * From the current folder

    ```shell
    sphinx-build docs build/html/current
    ```

    The updated documentation for the current local branch should now be in the `build/html/current` folder (no subfolders).
