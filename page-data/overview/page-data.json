This will allow a user to query two or more graphs at once with cypher, decide how to merge them, and get the desired query outputs. \n* AGE will be enhanced with an aim to support all of the key features of AgensGraph (PostgreSQL fork extended with graph DB functionality).\n\n<div class=\"OverviewLink\">\n\n[View Code](https://github.com/apache/age) [Download](/download)\n\n</div>\n\n<br /><br />\n\n# AGE Viewer\n\nApache AGE® Viewer is a graph visualization tool, for Apache AGE.\n\n* This is a visualization tool.
