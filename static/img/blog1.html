              Graph databases are like digital maps that show how different pieces of information are connected. Apache AGE makes these maps using the
              popular relational database called PostgreSQL, making it smarter. Graphizer is a tool developed by Bitnine for Apache AGE to make
              creating and understanding these maps easier for everyone.
            </p>

            <h5 class="mt-5">The Need for Simplicity in Graph Databases></h5>
            <p>
              Starting with graph databases can be tough, like learning a new language. It's hard to see how information connects and to ask the right
              questions. Tools like Graphizer are important because they make this learning journey smoother, letting more people use these smart
              databases without getting lost.
            </p>

            <div class="text-center mt-5 mb-4">
              <img src="../../img/image4.png" alt="img" class="img-fluid" />
            </div>

            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
              <p style="text-align: center; width: 80%">Image: Graphizer</p>
            </div>

            <p class="mt-5">
              One of the standout features of Graphizer is its ability to create graph models and data without needing to learn or use openCypher. For
              many who are used to traditional relational databases, the jump to graph databases can be scary, primarily due to the need to understand
              new querying languages like openCypher. Graphizer simplifies this transition. It offers intuitive tools that allow users to build and
              explore graph data with visual interfaces, bypassing the complexity of coding queries. This means you can focus on what your data tells
              you, not on memorizing syntax and commands, making the move to graph databases smoother and more approachable for relational database
              users.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-5">Take for example the following openCypher query:</p>

            <p class="mt-5">MATCH (m:Movie)<-[:Act_in]-(p:Person)-[:Produced]->(m), <br />RETURN p, m</p>

            <p class="mt-5">
              Which looks for a pattern within the graph database where a person has acted in one movie and also produced it. With Graphizer you can
              just enter a “Visual Query” like in the following image, having the same result as the openCypher query we used. Simply like that, you
              are in the world of graph databases.

            <h5 class="mt-5">Graph Data Viewing Feature</h5>

            <p>
              Graphizer lets you see the connections between points of information (nodes) and the lines that connect them (edges) easily. Imagine
              looking at a family tree; Graphizer helps you see who is related to whom at a glance, without having to dig through lots of details.
            </p>

              <img src="../../img/image6.png" alt="img" class="img-fluid" />
            </div>

            <h5 class="mt-5">Data Loading Feature</h5>
            <p>
              Graphizer is great at taking lists of information, like those in table data files (CSV and RDB files), and turning them into a graph.
              This is like turning a flat picture into a 3D model, showing how everything is connected in a way that’s easy to understand.

            <h5 class="mt-5">Exploring Feature</h5>

            <p>
              With Graphizer, you can dive into your data like a detective, using tools to find out how things are related. It's like having a
              magnifying glass to see the clues in your data, helping you make sense of it through pictures, patterns and filters.

              <span style="color: #ce697d">ocial media, spotting fraudsters, or recommending what book you should read next</span>. They turn complex
              info into easy-to-understand maps, making solving problems or finding opportunities easier.
