Unlike relational databases that store data in tables with rows and columns, graph databases use graph structures comprising nodes (entities), edges (relationships), and properties (attributes) to represent and store data.</p>\n          <p>The main differences between graph databases and relational databases include:</p>\n          <p><strong>Data Structure:</strong> Graph databases utilize nodes and edges to represent entities and their relationships, facilitating direct storage of relationship data. Relational databases use tables, where relationships are inferred through joins.</p>\n          <p><strong>Query Performance:</strong> Graph databases excel in scenarios requiring extensive traversal of relationships, making them ideal for complex networks like social networks, recommendation engines, and more. Relational databases can struggle with performance as the complexity and volume of relationships increase.</p>\n          <p><strong>Schema Flexibility:</strong> Graph databases often offer more flexibility with schema-less designs, allowing easier modification of the data model. Relational databases typically require a predefined schema, making alterations more challenging.</p>\n          <p>Apache AGE extends PostgreSQL, enabling it to function as a graph database. This allows users to leverage graph database capabilities within a familiar relational database environment, offering the best of both worlds: the robustness and ACID compliance of PostgreSQL with the flexibility and relationship-handling prowess of graph databases.</p>\n        </>\n      ),\n    }\n    ,\n\n      { id: 2, question: 'Q 2 : What is the best way for someone to get started with Apache AGE?
