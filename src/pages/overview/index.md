**Apache AGE®** is a PostgreSQL extension that provides graph database functionality. The goal of Apache AGE is to enable Postgres users to gain access to graph query modeling in Postgres’ existing relational model.

**Apache AGE®** is a Top-Level Project of the Apache Software Foundation since May 2022. It is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

Below is a brief overview of the AGE architecture, similar to the PostgreSQL architecture and backend. Every component runs on the PostgreSQL transaction cache layer and storage layer.

\* Support for PostgreSQL 13 will be implemented in Q1 2023. Support for PostgreSQL 14 & 15 will be added by the end of Q1 2023.
