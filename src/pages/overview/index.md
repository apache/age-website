**Apache AGE™** is a PostgreSQL extension that provides graph database functionality. The goal of Apache AGE is to enable Postgres users to gain access to graph query modeling in Postgres’ existing relational model.

**Apache AGE™** is a Top-Level Project of the Apache Software Foundation since May 2022. It is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

Below is a brief overview of the AGE architecture, similar to the PostgreSQL architecture and backend. Every component runs on the PostgreSQL transaction cache layer and storage layer.
