# SKIP

SKIP defines from which record to start including the records in the output.

## Introduction

By using SKIP, the result set will get trimmed from the top. Please note that no guarantees are made on the order of the result unless the query specifies the ORDER BY clause. SKIP accepts any expression that evaluates to a positive  integer.

## Skip first three rows

To return a subset of the result, starting from the top, use this syntax:

Query


```
SELECT *
FROM cypher('graph_name', $$
	MATCH (n)
	RETURN n.name
	ORDER BY n.name
	SKIP 3
$$) as (names agtype);
```


The node is returned, and no property age exists on it.

Result


<table>
  <thead>
   <td><strong>names</strong>
   </td>
  <thead>
  <tr>
   <td>"D"
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>"E"
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>2 rows
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Return middle two rows

To return a subset of the result, starting from somewhere in the middle, use this syntax:

Query


```
SELECT *
FROM cypher('graph_name', $$
	MATCH (n)
	RETURN n.name
	ORDER BY n.name
	SKIP 1
	LIMIT 2
$$) as (names agtype);
```

Two vertices from the middle are returned.

Result


<table>
  <thead>
   <td><strong>names</strong>
   </td>
  <thead>
  <tr>
   <td>"B"
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>"C"
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>2 rows
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Using an expression with SKIP to return a subset of the rows

Using an expression with SKIP to return a subset of the rows

Query


```
SELECT *
FROM cypher('graph_name', $$
	MATCH (n)
	RETURN n.name
	ORDER BY n.name
	SKIP (3 * rand())+ 1
$$) as (a agtype);
```

The first two vertices are skipped, and only the last three are returned in the result.

Result


<table>
  <thead>
   <td><strong>names</strong>

  <thead>
  <tr>
   <td>"C"
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>"D"
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>"E"
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>3 rows
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
