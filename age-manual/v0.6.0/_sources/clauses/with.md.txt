# WITH

## Introduction

Using WITH, you can manipulate the output before it is passed on to the following query parts. The manipulations can be of the shape and/or number of entries in the result set.

WITH can also, like RETURN, alias expressions that are introduced into the results using the aliases as the binding name.

WITH is also used to separate the reading of the graph from updating of the graph. Every part of a query must be either read-only or write-only. When going from a writing part to a reading part, the switch can be done with an optional WITH clause.


## Filter on aggregate function results

Aggregated results have to pass through a WITH clause to be able to filter on.

Query
```
SELECT *
FROM cypher('graph_name', $$
	MATCH (david {name: 'David'})-[]-(otherPerson)-[]->()
	WITH otherPerson, count(*) AS foaf
	WHERE foaf > 1RETURN otherPerson.name
	RETURN otherPerson.name
$$) as (name agtype);
```


The name of the person connected to 'David' with the at least more than one outgoing relationship will be returned by the query.

Result
<table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
   <td>name
   </td>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>"Anders"
   </td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>1 row
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



## Sort results before using collect on them

You can sort your results before passing them to collect, thus sorting the resulting list.

Query
```
SELECT *
FROM cypher('graph_name', $$
	MATCH (n)WITH n
	ORDER BY n.name DESC LIMIT 3
	RETURN collect(n.name)
$$) as (names agtype);
```


A list of the names of people in reverse order, limited to 3, is returned in a list.

Result
<table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
   <td>names
   </td>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>["Emil","David","Ceasar"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>1 row
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Limit branching of a path search

You can match paths, limit to a certain number, and then match again using those paths as a base,as well as any number of similar limited searches.

Query

```
SELECT *
FROM cypher('graph_name', $$
	MATCH (n {name: 'Anders'})-[]-(m)WITH m
	ORDER BY m.name DESC LIMIT 1
	MATCH (m)-[]-(o)
	RETURN o.name
$$) as (name agtype);
```


Starting at 'Anders', find all matching nodes, order by name descending and get the top result, thenfind all the nodes connected to that top result, and return their names.

Result
<table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
   <td>name
   </td>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>"Anders"
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>"Bossman"
   </td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>2 rows
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
