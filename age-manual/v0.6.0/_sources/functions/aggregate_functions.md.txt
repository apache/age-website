Functions that activate [auto aggregation](../intro/aggregation#).

## Data Setup
```
LOAD 'age';
SET search_path TO ag_catalog;

SELECT create_graph('graph_name');

SELECT * FROM cypher('graph_name', $$
	CREATE (a:Person {name: 'A', age: 13}),
	(b:Person {name: 'B', age: 33, eyes: "blue"}),
	(c:Person {name: 'C', age: 44, eyes: "blue"}),
	(d1:Person {name: 'D', eyes: "brown"}),
	(d2:Person {name: 'D'}),
	(a)-[:KNOWS]->(b),
	(a)-[:KNOWS]->(c),
	(a)-[:KNOWS]->(d1),
	(b)-[:KNOWS]->(d2),
	(c)-[:KNOWS]->(d2)
$$) as (a agtype);
```

## min

min() returns the minimum value in a set of values.


Syntax: `min(expression)`

Returns:


```
A property type, or a list, depending on the values returned by expression.
```


Arguments:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Name
   </td>
   <td>Description
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>expression
   </td>
   <td>An expression returning a set containing any combination of property types and lists thereof.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Considerations:



* Any null values are excluded from the calculation.
* In a mixed set, any string value is always considered to be lower than any numeric value, and anylist is always considered to be lower than any string.
* Lists are compared in dictionary order, i.e. list elements are compared pairwise in ascending order from the start of the list to the end.
* min(null) returns null.

Query


```
SELECT *
FROM cypher('graph_name', $$
    MATCH (v:Person)
    RETURN min(v.age)
$$) as (min_age agtype);
```


Result:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>min_age
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>2123e1af756543542064ae0d07792be90176b311be
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>1 row(s) returned
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



### Using min() with Lists

Data Setup:

To clarify the following example, assume the next three commands are run first:


```
SELECT * FROM cypher('graph_name', $$ 
    CREATE (:min_test {val:'d'})
$$) as (result agtype);

SELECT * FROM cypher('graph_name', $$
    CREATE (:min_test {val:['a', 'b', 23]})
$$) as (result agtype);

SELECT * FROM cypher('graph_name', $$ 
    CREATE (:min_test {val:['a', 'b', 23]})
$$) as (result agtype);
```


Query


```
SELECT *
FROM cypher('graph_name', $$
    MATCH (v:min_test)
    RETURN min(v.val)
$$) as (min_val agtype);
```


The lowest of all the values in the set—in this case, the list ['a', 'c', 23]—is returned, as (i) the two lists are considered to be lower values than the string "d", and (ii) the string "a" is considered tobe a lower value than the numerical value 1.

Result:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>min_age
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>["a", "b", 23]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>1 row(s) returned
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



## max

max() returns the maximum value in a set of values.

Syntax: `max(expression)`

Returns:


```
A property type, or a list, depending on the values returned by expression.
```


Arguments:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Name
   </td>
   <td>Description
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>expression
   </td>
   <td>An expression returning a set containing any combination of property types and lists thereof.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Considerations:



* Any null values are excluded from the calculation.
* In a mixed set, any numeric value is always considered to be higher than any string value, and anystring value is always considered to be higher than any list.
* Lists are compared in dictionary order, i.e. list elements are compared pairwise in ascending order from the start of the list to the end.
* max(null) returns null.

Query:


```
SELECT *
FROM cypher('graph_name', $$
    MATCH (n:Person)
    RETURN max(n.age)
$$) as (max_age agtype);
```


The highest of all the values in the property age is returned.

Result:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>min_age
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>44
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>1 row(s) returned
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



## stDev

stDev() returns the standard deviation for the given value over a group. It uses a standard two-pass method, with N - 1 as the denominator, and should be used when taking a sample of the population for an unbiased estimate. When the standard variation of the entire population is being calculated, stdDevP should be used.

Syntax: `stDev(expression)`

Returns: 


```
An agtype Float.
```


Arguments:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Name
   </td>
   <td>Description
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>expression
   </td>
   <td>An agtype number expression
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Considerations:



* Any null values are excluded from the calculation.
* stDev(null) returns 0.

Query


```

   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

When the standard variation of only a sample of the population is being calculated, stDev should be used.

Syntax: `stDevP(expression)`

Returns:


```
An agtype Float.
```


Arguments:


<table>
  <tr>

  <tr>
   <td>expression
   </td>
   <td>An agtype number expression

   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



## percentileCont

percentileCont() returns the percentile of the given value over a group, with a percentile from 0.0 to 1.0. It uses a linear interpolation method, calculating a weighted average between two values if the desired percentile lies between them. For nearest values using a rounding method, see percentileDisc.

Syntax: `percentileCont(expression, percentile)`

Returns:


```
An agtype Float.

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>percentile
   </td>
   <td>An agtype number value between 0.0 and 1.0
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Considerations:

Query


```
SELECT *
FROM cypher('graph_name', $$
    MATCH (n:Person)
    RETURN percentileCont(n.age, 0.4)
$$ as (percentile_cont_age agtype);
```


The 40th percentile of the values in the property age is returned, calculated with a weighted average. In this case, 0.4 is the median, or 40th percentile.

Result:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>percentile_cont_age
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>29.0
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>1 row(s) returned
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



## percentileDisc

percentileDisc() returns the percentile of the given value over a group, with a percentile from 0.0to 1.0. It uses a rounding method and calculates the nearest value to the percentile. For interpolated values, see percentileCont.

Returns:


```
An agtype Float.
```


Arguments:


<table>

Query


```
SELECT *
FROM cypher('graph_name', $$
    MATCH (n:Person)
    RETURN percentileDisc(n.age, 0.5)
$$ as (percentile_disc_age agtype);
```


The 50th percentile of the values in the property age is returned. 

Result:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>percentile_cont_age

## count

count() returns the number of values or records, and appears in two variants:



* count(*) returns the number of matching records
* count(expr) returns the number of non-null values returned by an expression.

Syntax: `count(expression)`

Returns:


```
An agtype Integer.
```


Arguments:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Name
   </td>
   <td>Description
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>expression
   </td>
   <td>An expression
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Considerations:
* count(*) includes records returning null.
* count(expr) ignores null values.
* count(null) returns 0.
* Using count(*) to return the number of nodes
* count(*) can be used to return the number of nodes; for example, the number of nodes connected to some node n.


Query
```
SELECT *
FROM cypher('graph_name', $$
    MATCH (n {name: 'A'})-[]->(x)
    RETURN n.age, count(*)
$$ as (age agtype, number_of_people agtype);
```

The labels and age property of the start node n and the number of nodes related to n are returned.

Result:
<table>
  <tr>
   <td>age
   </td>
   <td>number_of_people
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>13
   </td>
   <td>3
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td colspan="2" >1 row(s) returned
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Using count(*) to group and count relationship typescount(*) can be used to group relationship types and return the number.

Query
```
SELECT *
FROM cypher('graph_name', $$
    MATCH (n {name: 'A'})-[r]->()
    RETURN type(r), count(*)
$$ as (label agtype, count agtype);
```


The relationship types and their group count are returned.

Result:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>label
   </td>
   <td>count
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>“KNOWS”
   </td>
   <td>3
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td colspan="2" >1 row(s) returned
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



### Using count(expression) to return the number of values

Instead of simply returning the number of records with count(*), it may be more useful to return the actual number of values returned by an expression.

Query


```
SELECT *
FROM cypher('graph_name', $$
    MATCH (n {name: 'A'})-[]->(x)
    RETURN count(x)
$$) as (count agtype);
```


The number of nodes connected to the start node is returned.

Result:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>count
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>3
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>1 row(s) returned
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



### Counting non-null values

count(expression) can be used to return the number of non-null values returned by the expression.

Query


```
SELECT *
FROM cypher('graph_name', $$
    MATCH (n:Person)
    RETURN count(n.age)
$$) as (count agtype);
```


The number of :Person nodes having an age property is returned.

Result:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>count
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>3
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>1 row(s) returned
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


### Counting with and without duplicates

In this example we are trying to find all our friends of friends, and count them:
* The first aggregate function, count(DISTINCT friend_of_friend), will only count a friend_of_friend once, as DISTINCT removes the duplicates.
* The second aggregate function, count(friend_of_friend), will consider the same friend_of_friend multiple times.

Query
```
SELECT *
FROM cypher('graph_name', $$
	MATCH (me:Person)-[]->(friend:Person)-[]->(friend_of_friend:Person)
	WHERE me.name = 'A'
	RETURN count(DISTINCT friend_of_friend), count(friend_of_friend)
$$) as (friend_of_friends_distinct agtype, friend_of_friends agtype);
```

Both B and C know D and thus D will get counted twice when not using DISTINCT

Result:
<table>
  <tr>
   <td>friend_of_friends_distinct
   </td>
   <td>friend_of_friends
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>1
   </td>
   <td>2
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>1 row
   </td>
  </tr>
