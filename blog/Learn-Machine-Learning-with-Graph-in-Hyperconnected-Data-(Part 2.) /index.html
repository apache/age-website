              Following our previous article on Hyperconnected data, this article will delve deeper into the applications of graph-based machine
              learning specifically in the realm of e-commerce data. We will explore the practical implementation of unsupervised learning-based
              'Graph Clustering' and supervised learning-based 'Graph node/Link Prediction' techniques, highlighting their significance in storing and
              harnessing results within a graph database. By understanding these powerful approaches, we can uncover valuable insights and optimize
              decision-making processes in the dynamic world of e-commerce.

              Once we understand the intricate product-purchase relationships within our e-commerce data, the next step is to cluster customers based
              on their shared properties. To accomplish this, we employ the 'Graph Projection' technique, which constructs a unified network by
              projecting a graph along specific relationships. By utilizing this approach, we can effectively visualize and analyze distinct customer
              clusters, uncovering valuable insights that can drive personalized marketing strategies and enhance overall customer experience.

              The relationship between <span style="font-weight: bolder">Customer A</span> and <span style="font-weight: bolder">Customer B</span>,
              connected through <span style="font-weight: bolder">the purchase relationships of the same product</span>, creates a view that
              facilitates a seamless connection between preceding relationships. This view acts as an edge, linking the edges of the graph projection.
            </p>

            <h5 class="mt-5">Querying the Single Relationships</h5>
            <p>First, we can ask simple questions to find out what products customers buy and what services they use.</p>
            <p class="mt-5">
              Essentially, we can construct a network comprising customers who have purchased the same product. From this network, we can employ a
              graph clustering algorithm to group customers based on structural similarities within the graph. The graph clustering algorithm analyzes
              the graph's structural features independently, allowing for the identification of distinctive characteristics within each cluster. Below
              is an example of a single network configuration and its characteristics when using the clustering algorithm, visualized as a graph.

            <h5 class="mt-5">Querying Features of Clusters</h5>

            <p>
              Focusing on products emerges a single network, revealing distinctive characteristics specific to each cluster. This network offers
              valuable insights and provides personalized recommendations to assist customers in finding what they truly need. Moreover, the
              configuration of this network unveils new meta-information beyond traditional categorization. Uncovering patterns of products purchased
              together suggests previously unseen characteristics of products, allowing for a deeper understanding of customer preferences and
              facilitating more targeted recommendations.

            <h5 class="mt-5">Node/Link Prediction</h5>
            <p>
              The results above demonstrate the meaningfulness of item purchases within the identified clusters. For instance, in Cluster 2, the
              purchase of cleaning supplies is appropriately grouped with the keyword 'Moving and Cleaning', enabling targeted product recommendations
              to customers in this cluster. Similarly, in Cluster 4, the purchases of furniture supplies are accurately associated with the keyword
              'Interior,' allowing for precise suggestions to enhance customers interior design needs. These cluster-specific associations highlight
              the power of leveraging customer behavior data to provide relevant and contextually appropriate recommendations, ultimately improving
              the overall customer experience.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-5">
              Beyond the established product categories, grouping, giving meta-information, and managing products relevant to the current era are also
              of the AGE's capability. These can be achieved utilizing Node/Link Prediction techniques, which enable the prediction and establishment
              of connections for items that have not yet been categorized or linked. By leveraging this approach, we can offer tailored
              recommendations that suggest customers with customer's genuine needs.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-5">
              Node prediction operates at the individual node level within the graph, allowing for accurate predictions regarding the characteristics
              of a given node. This prediction is analyzed based on the relationships with irregular neighbouring nodes.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-5">
              Link Prediction is a technique to predict the likelihood of a connection between two individual nodes without existing connections. By
              successfully establishing these previously unexplored relationships, the utility of information within the network significantly
              enhances.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-5">
              In addition to traditional recommendation systems that rely on similarity-based approaches, Link prediction, when combined with Node
              prediction, facilitates recommendations based on similarities and discovers valuable information about the characteristics of newly
              defined nodes. This expanded data discovery opens up new avenues for exploration and analysis, ultimately boosting confidence in the
              generated results.
