              knowledge generation process. ChatGPT excels at delivering
              accurate answers, but achieving this precision often demands
              intricate and nuanced text prompts. Navigation and instruction of
              ChatGPT could often be challenging without guidance in the input
              text methods. In this regard, it is imperative to harness GPT's
              versatility by tapping into a variety of information sources,
              encompassing images. For instance, by introducing the user's
              hyper-personalized attributes in a simple user interface, the
              accuracy and relevance of information can be tailored to
              individual users.
            </p>
            <p>
              To extend the information output from ChatGPT meaningfully, the
              specific information that the user needs must be identified from
              the collected pieces of information derived. In reality, however,
              GPT offers multifaceted textual information, which can be
              overwhelming for users seeking value within its output. To address
              this challenge, transforming the information produced by GPT into
              a 'knowledge graph' becomes a valuable approach. By mapping the
              connections between data points output by GPT onto a graph, it
              becomes feasible to visualize and index the desired information,
              uncover additional insights, and streamline GPT's knowledge
              management.

            </p>
            <p>
              In today's fast-paced world, many individuals have encountered the
              predicament of having to prepare a meal when faced with limited
              ingredients. Furthermore, tailoring a dish to one's specific
              dietary needs and personal preferences can be challenging. Let's
              tackle this by leveraging ChatGPT's capabilities along with the
              knowledge graph framework, empowering users to access top-tier
              insights with the simplest of inputs.
            </p>
            <div class="text-center mt-5 mb-4">

            <p>
              The above two models are used for extracting food recipes and
              information from the images of the ingredients in the fridge. As a
              first prompt, using object detection algorithms such as R-CNN or
              YOLO models, the ingredients present in the fridge are extracted.
              As for the second input value, it pertains to the user's unique
              preferences. To ensure accurate prompts, predefined options such
              as select boxes or radio buttons are employed.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this workflow, both the ingredient list and the user's
              preferences are integrated into the ChatGPT prompt using a
              standardized format. Subsequently, GPT employs this data to craft
              a text output encompassing potential dishes, ingredients, recipes,
              and nutritional insights tailored to the user's specific traits,
              including factors like appetite, age, and time zone. This
              meticulous prompt engineering, which leverages both images and
              user characteristics, yields high-quality information to enhance
              the overall user experience.
            </p>

            <h5>Knowledge management using Graphs</h5>
            <p>
              When you input ingredients and user preferences into ChatGPT, the
              generated output comprises a 'dish,' 'recipe,' available
              ingredients, and additional ingredients suitable for the user. In
              Figure 4. below, by entering items like cabbage, tomato, and
              seaweed in your pantry, along with dinner preferences, dietary
              requirements, and age, GPT generates results related to 'cooking'
              and 'nutritional ingredients' as illustrated. This information is
              easily visualized through graphs and can be extracted into
              actionable knowledge.
            </p>
            <div class="text-center mt-5 mb-4">

                a graph (a circle with red border is information that can be
                obtained through ChatGPT, red dotted arrow indicates additional
                information that is recommended from information through
                ChatGPT)
              </p>
            </div>

            <p>
              Given that actual GPT information often spans over 70 lines of
              text, comprehending the desired details and their relationships
              can be challenging. Utilizing a graphical representation, you can
              observe that 'cabbage salad' was suggested as a recommended dish,
              along with 'salt and pepper' as essential cooking ingredients.
              Furthermore, dietary insights like 'dietary fiber' and 'digestion'
              were provided for users in the 'elderly' age group.
            </p>

            <p>
              By leveraging these complex information interconnections, users
              can extract knowledge from GPT-generated data and discern common
              patterns among essential information elements.
            </p>
            <p>
              This graph model can further be advanced into meal planning
              recommendations using the ingredients or nutrients in the food
              information. For example, by clicking on the 'cabbage, and
              'tomato' nodes of an ingredient and putting them back into the GPT
              input prompt, it returns a dish that can be made with those
              ingredients, such as 'tomato-cabbage stir-fry'. If one clicks on
              the 'dietary fiber' and 'digestion' nodes in the nutrition
              component, 'older' and 'diet' are the most relevant
              characteristics through the edge search of the graph, leading to
              the 'seaweed soup' as a recommended dish.
            </p>
            <p>
              This way, knowledge management using graphs enables users to
              secure visibility and identity and explore relationships between
              information to identify causality and relevance. A simple
              graph-type UI/UX also helps improve the productivity of ChatGPT by
              clicking on the appropriate node providing a data environment in a
              simple form that allows other food recommendations without having
              to separate prompt engineering.
            </p>
