            <h5>Cybersecurity Background</h5>
            <p>
              In today's world, the internet has transformed how we connect, work, and access information, bringing unparalleled convenience and
              connectivity. This digital revolution, however, has its challenges, especially in cybersecurity. As we depend more on technology, the
              need to protect sensitive data and counteract cyber threats becomes increasingly critical.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
              Cybersecurity is about safeguarding our computer systems, networks, and data from theft, damage, or unauthorized access. A key part of
              this field is network intrusion detection. It's like a digital watchdog, constantly monitoring network traffic for any signs of
              suspicious activities, such as hacking attempts or unauthorized entries. The aim is to catch and address these threats early, preventing
              any harm to our networks or data.
            </p>
            <p>
              In essence, cybersecurity and network intrusion detection are vital in our tech-driven world, ensuring our digital safety and resilience
              against ever-evolving cyber threats.
            </p>
            <h5>Data Overview</h5>
            <p>
              In the realm of cybersecurity, graph analysis plays a crucial role. To illustrate this, we use the CIDDS-001 dataset, specifically
              designed for network intrusion detection. This dataset serves as a benchmark for evaluating how different intrusion detection systems
              perform in identifying network attacks. It simulates a small business environment, complete with clients and servers, like email and web
              servers. The behaviors on these clients are mimicked using Python scripts, and the dataset includes unidirectional NetFlow data,
              capturing the flow of network traffic.
            </p>
            <div class="text-center mt-5 mb-4">
              <img src="../../img/xai-1.png" alt="img" class="img-fluid" />
            </div>

            <h5>Figure1. Graph Modeling</h5>
            <p>
              Graph analysis in cybersecurity involves transforming relational data into a graph format, consisting of nodes (points) and edges
              (connections). There are two main types of graphs:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Homogeneous Graphs:</strong>
                These have nodes and edges of a single type, similar to what you'd find in social networks with user nodes connected by 'follow'
                edges.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong class="font-weight-bold">Heterogeneous Graphs:</strong>
                These contain multiple types of nodes and edges, like in e-commerce networks where interactions between users and items are tracked
                through different types of connections such as 'buy,' 'cart,' and 'view.'
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              Using the
              <a
                href="https://www.hs-coburg.de/forschung/forschungsprojekte-oeffentlich/informationstechnologie/cidds-coburg-intrusion-detection-data-sets.html"
                >CIDDS-001 dataset</a
              >
              , we create a graph for network flow analysis. This includes nodes representing start and end points in the network, and edges of
              various types like 'benign,' 'dos,' 'portscan,' 'pingscan,' and 'bruteforce.' A key feature of this graph is the detailed information
              attached to each node and edge, such as ports, packet sizes, and timestamps. This level of detail is particularly valuable in
              cybersecurity, where quick and precise responses are crucial.
            </p>

            <h5>Cypher Query with Analysis Scenario</h5>
            <p>
              In this section, we explore how the PostgreSQL extension
              <a href="https://age.apache.org/"> Apache AGE's</a> graph analysis capabilities, particularly through Cypher queries, can be leveraged
              in cybersecurity. We'll look at three different scenarios, each demonstrating the power and flexibility of Cypher queries in analyzing
              network data.
            </p>
            <div class="text-center mt-5 mb-4">
              <img src="../../img/xai-2.png" alt="img" class="img-fluid" />
            </div>

            <h5>Figure2. Graph Query with Condition</h5>
            <p>
              Figure 2 showcases a Cypher query that focuses on identifying network packets larger than a certain size. This is a prime example of the
              'condition' function in Apache AGE, which is crucial for pinpointing specific scenarios. Here, the query filters out packets larger than
              10 units, helping analysts spot potential anomalies or threats in network traffic. This function isn't limited to just packet size; it
              can be tailored to various criteria, making it a versatile tool for cybersecurity analysis.
            </p>
            <div class="text-center mt-5 mb-4">
              <img src="../../img/xai-3.png" alt="img" class="img-fluid" />
            </div>
            <h5>Figure3. Multi-path Search with Union Query</h5>
            <p>
              In Figure 3, we see a union query in
              <a href="https://age.apache.org/"> Apache AGE</a>, demonstrating its ability to handle complex, multi-path searches. This is
              particularly useful in scenarios where you need to analyze data across different types of connections, like 'eg_portscan' and
              'eg_pingscan.' <a href="https://age.apache.org/"> Apache AGE</a> also enhances this analysis with visual aids, like representing the
              weight of packets through the thickness of edges in the graph, making it easier to interpret the data visually.
            </p>
            <div class="text-center mt-5 mb-4">
              <img src="../../img/xai-4.png" alt="img" class="img-fluid" />
            </div>
            <h5>Figure4. Bi-directional Path Search</h5>

            <p>
              The final example, illustrated in Figure 4, is a bi-directional path search. This Cypher query uncovers one-to-many relationships
              between nodes, providing a detailed view of network interactions and potential security incidents. It's particularly adept at revealing
              complex patterns and relationships that might be missed with traditional analysis methods. By tracing paths involving different types of
              nodes and connections, this query helps in identifying multi-step attack patterns and potential sources or targets of cyberattacks.
            </p>
            <p>
              In summary, these scenarios highlight the strength of
              <a href="https://age.apache.org/"> Apache AGE</a> in cybersecurity. Through its advanced graph analysis capabilities,
              <a href="https://age.apache.org/"> Apache AGE</a> enables cybersecurity professionals to uncover deep insights into network activities,
              detect threats more effectively, and enhance the overall security of network infrastructures.
            </p>

              representing network nodes, edges, and their attributes, it becomes easier for analysts to decode complex structures, spot anomalies,
              and respond swiftly to potential threats. This visual approach aids in proactive security measures, allowing teams to trace unusual
              activities, map out attack routes, and pinpoint potential sources of cyber threats, thereby improving overall security awareness and
              decision-making.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another significant aspect of
              <a href="https://age.apache.org/"> Apache AGE's</a>graph analysis is the labeled property graph model. This approach enriches nodes and
              edges with detailed metadata, capturing essential information about cyber incidents. Such rich data representation not only aids in
              precise threat categorization but also supports thorough post-incident analysis. This helps organizations learn from past experiences,
              enhancing their defensive strategies against future cyber threats.
            </p>
            <p>
